- 👋 Hi, I’m Fazal Abbas
- 👀 I’m interested in Physics, mathematics, space sciences & quantum information processing. These are the areas that always inspired me to pursue a career as a scientist.
- 🌱 I’m currently exploring the field of quantum computing. I am always curious to explore natural physical processes/phenomena in other domains of engineering and technology and quantum information processing is one of the many areas of research that motivates me. I have attended national and international summer schools/workshops on quantum computing to explore deeper in the field.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some cool projects related to quantum science and physics combined with computer science in general.
